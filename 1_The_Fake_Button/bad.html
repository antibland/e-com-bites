  <!-- Attempt 1: "The Classic Fake Button"
    1. Accessibility suffers when anchors are used in place of native buttons.
    2. Some browsers don't allow users to tab to the anchor
    3. Screen readers don't provide helpful announcements for links meant to be buttons
  -->
  <a href="#" class="button">Click here</a>

  <!-- Attempt 2: Adding a role attribute
    Adding a role is a slow crawl towards accessibility. It's better for screen readers, but
    the focus problem is still there.
  -->
  <a role="button" href="#" class="button">Click here</a>

  <!-- Attempt 3: Adding a tabindex attribute to allow for focus
    After all this, you've managed to achieve a better UX (not for all browsers, though). In
    the end, it's a lot of needless effort.
  -->
  <a tabindex="0" role="button" href="#" class="button">Click here</a>

  <!-- The golden rule of buttons vs. links: Links go places; buttons do things -->
